    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two Months.</p>

<p>That is all that is left of this adventure called <a href="http://turing.io">gSchool</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost unreal to think&hellip; it&rsquo;s already been four months since we were all
thrown into a room with Jessie Shternshus from the <a href="http://www.improveffect.com">Improv
Effect</a>. Pushed out of our comfort zones and pushed
into (rather amazing) group building activities.</p>

<p>Now, four months later, that day seems like a dream of some other time.
Years ago, even.</p>

<p>The day in day out pushing and being pushed has grown into the norm. We&rsquo;ve
become accustomed to seeing each other&rsquo;s smiling (or very very tired) faces.
Friendships have blossomed and been cultivated by this experience.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what clear vision, a common goal, and constanty opportunity can do
to a group of people. You start as strangers and transition into family.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see, as these next 8 weeks unravel and provide job
opportunities &ndash; and new life opportunities &ndash; where we all end up.</p>
